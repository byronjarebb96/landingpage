# The Odin Project - Landing Page
This is The Odin Project's first big-ish assigned project. It involves utilizing every technique learned from the HTML/CSS lessons of its Foundations course. 

## Building the Start of my Professional Portfolio
I've always been interested in creating a portfolio of my professional and creative projects and this project seems to be the perfect starting point for both. In place of the dummy text and placeholder media that the project advised, I tried building a small landing page showcasing some of my music work.

## Struggles?
Funnily enough, the hardest part for me to get right was the Call-To-Action button towards the end of the project. I just couldn't get it to display in the center. Turns out, it was a result of adding way too many divs within divs that formatting it is nigh-impossible. Got everything sorted out, though! Simplifying stuff is usually the best way to go.

## Things I Want to Change In The Near Future
- Add indications that the "cards" in section 2 are links
- Add an actual logo
- Add a section for professional stuff, ideally linking to other Projects I'll be doing for The Odin Project
- Make it mobile-friendly
